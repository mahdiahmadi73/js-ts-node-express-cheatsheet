# JS-TS-NODE-EXPRESS-CHEATSHEET

This is my personal cheat sheet for learning **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Express**. It contains examples and notes to help me track my progress and revisit key concepts.

## Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s how the project is organized:

- **`core-js/`**: General JavaScript concepts and examples.
  - **`arrays/`**: Examples for working with arrays (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
  - **`arrow-functions/`**: Examples for arrow functions and their `this` behavior.
  - **`promises/`**: Examples for promises and async/await patterns.
  - **`objects/`**: Examples for creating and manipulating objects.

- **`typescript/`**: Examples of TypeScript features like types, interfaces, and generics.

- **`node/`**: Node.js-specific examples, such as working with the file system, modules, and HTTP servers.

- **`express/`**: Examples for Express.js, including middleware, REST APIs, and basic servers.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JS-TS-NODE-EXPRESS-CHEATSHEET.git
   cd JS-TS-NODE-EXPRESS-CHEATSHEET
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run Examples: To run specific examples, use the node command. For example**:

```bash
node core-js/arrow-functions/example1.js
```
4. **Run Main File: Alternatively, you can run the main.js file to see multiple examples**:

```bash
node main.js

```
